	abstract = "Conventional storage management systems provide one interface for accessing memory segments and another for accessing secondary storage objects. This hinders application programming and affects overall system performance due to mandatory data copying and user/kernel boundary crossings, which in the microkernel case may involve context switches. Memory-mapping techniques may be used to provide programmers with a unified view of the storage system. This paper extends such techniques to support a shared data object model for distributed computing environments in which good support for coherence and synchronization is essential. The approach is based on a microkernel, typed memory objects, and integrated coherence control. A microkernel architecture is used to support multiple coherence protocols and the addition of new protocols. Memory objects are typed and applications can choose the most suitable protocols for different types of object to avoid protocol mismatch. Low-level coherence control is integrated with high-level concurrency control so that the number of messages required to maintain memory coherence is reduced and system-wide synchronization is realized without severely impacting the system performance. These features together contribute a novel approach to the support for flexible coherence under application control."

	abstract = "Summary form only given. Efficient packet forwarding is central to moving traffic smoothly through the Internet. For example, at a line rate of 10Gbps and a minimum packet size of 40 bytes, an Internet router must process more than 30 million packets per second. At 80Gbps, more than 240 million packets must be processed per second. At its simplest, packet processing involves extracting the packet's destination address, doing a look up in a router table of size up to about 1 million, and sending the packet to its next hop as determined by the table lookup. Besides providing a very high look up rate, an Internet router must be able to update its lookup table at rates that are of the order of 50,000 updates per second (peak). The extreme performance demand on an Internet router may be somewhat reduced by maintaining an additional flow table, filtering out packets that correspond to a packet in the flow table, and doing a router table lookup only for those packets that do not correspond to an existing flow. Power consumption is another very important consideration in the design of an Internet router. For example, Sekiguchi projects that with a 40% annual growth in Internet traffic, the energy consumed by routers in Japan in 2022 will exceed the 2005 gross power generation of Japan. Extensive research has been conducted to develop good data structures to meet the lookup and update requirements of a router as well as to reduce power consumption. This talk reviews some of this research as well as current trends in router design. Sample data structures include multibit one- and two-dimensional tries and hybrid shape shifting tries. Hardware assisted solutions such as Ternary Content Addressable Memories also are reviewed. For more details, see the listed references.",

Thus, finding the best possible learning model in combination with extracting the best possible feature-set is a necessary requirement to design accurate traffic classification models. While feature selection can be automated to find the best subset of a given set of features, there are no known mechanisms to solve the problem of feature extraction. Thus, extracting the best possible features has to be done empirically. In this work we present a framework to simplify the empirical model selection and feature extraction process.",

	abstract = "Packet classification is primarily used by network devices, such as routers and firewalls, to do additional processing for a specific subset of packets. Such additional processing includes packet filtering, quality of service (QoS), and differentiated services (DiffServ). Most of the existing packet classification algorithms reported in the literature exploits the characteristics of filtering or classifier rules in optimizing their techniques. However, the seminal observation made by Gupta and McKeown that a given packet matches only few rules in the classifier shows promise to another direction that packet classifier's average performance can be improved by exploiting the locality in the incoming traffic pattern. In this paper, we undertook the investigation of finding the feasibility of exploiting the locality in traffic to improve packet classifier's average performance. Our lightweight traffic-aware packet classifier reorganizes its internal data structure (rule tree) based on the traffic pattern to reduce the search time for the most frequently visited rules in the rule-set. Unlike existing traffic-adaptive packet classifier requiring a separate, offline reorganization phase, our approach performs reorganization online with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising the accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that our traffic-adaptive packet classifier incurs small number of memory accesses (i.e. less time per packet) in order to classify the packet.",

These techniques are applicable over different timescales, have different run-time overheads, and require different levels of monitoring and control software inside the network. We present results both from detailed simulations and a complete implementation using software IP routers.

	abstract = "Mockets is a comprehensive communications library designed to address challenges specific to mobile ad-hoc networks. Mockets have been implemented at the application-level to simplify deployment and portability. Both stream-oriented and message-oriented abstractions are supported, with the message-oriented service providing multiple classes of service (reliable, unreliable, sequenced, unsequenced), message tagging and replacement, and prioritization. Mockets also interfaces with a policy management infrastructure to support bandwidth limitation. Finally, mockets supports transparent migration of communication endpoints across hosts without the need to terminate and reestablish connections. Mockets provides similar semantics to TCP but performs better than TCP on ad-hoc networks",

	abstract = "For the past 20 years (1980-2000), applications and end users of the TCP/IP suite have employed one of two protocols: the transmission control protocol or the user datagram protocol. Yet some applications already require greater functionality than what either TCP or UDP has to offer, and future applications might require even more. To extend transport layer functionality, the Internet Engineering Task Force approved the stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) as a proposed standard in October 2000. SUP was spawned from an effort started in the IETF Signaling Transport (Sigtrans) working group to develop a specialized transport protocol for call control signaling in voice-over-IP (VoIP) networks. Recognizing that other applications could use some of the new protocol's capabilities, the IETF now embraces SCTP as a general-purpose transport layer protocol, joining TCP and UDP above the IP layer. Like TCP, STCP offers a point-to-point, connection-oriented, reliable delivery transport service for applications communicating over an IP network",

	abstract = "For network-on-chip (NoC) designs, optimizing buffers is an essential task since buffers are a major source of cost and power consumption. This paper proposes flow regulation and has defined a regulation spectrum as a means for system-on-chip architects to control delay and backlog bounds. The regulation is performed per flow for its peak rate and burstiness. However, many flows may have conflicting regulation requirements due to interferences with each other. Based on the regulation spectrum, this paper optimizes the regulation parameters aiming for buffer optimization. Three timing-constrained buffer optimization problems are formulated, namely, buffer size minimization, buffer variance minimization, and multiobjective optimization, which has both buffer size and variance as minimization objectives. Minimizing buffer variance is also important because it affects the modularity of routers and network interfaces. A realistic case study exhibits 62.8% reduction of total buffers, 84.3% reduction of total latency, and 94.4% reduction on the sum of variances of buffers. Likewise, the experimental results demonstrate similar improvements in the case of synthetic traffic patterns. The optimization algorithm has low run-time complexity, enabling quick exploration of large design spaces. This paper concludes that optimal flow regulation can be a highly valuable instrument for buffer optimization in NoC designs.",

	abstract = " Due to increasing number of network worms and virus, many computer network users are vulnerable to attacks. Unless network security systems use more advanced methods of content filtering such as deep packet inspection, the problem get worse. However, searching for patterns at multiple offsets in entire content of network packet requires more processing power than most general purpose processor can provide. Thus, researchers have developed high performance parallel deep packet filters for reconfigurable devices. Although some reconfigurable systems can be generated automatically from pattern database, obtaining high performance result from each subsequent reconfiguration can be a time consuming process. We present a novel architecture for programmable parallel pattern matching coprocessor. By combining a scalable coprocessor with the compact reconfigurable filter, we produce a hybrid system that is able to update the rules immediate during the time the new filter is being compiled. We mapped our hybrid filter for the latest Snort rule set on January 13, 2005, containing 2,044 unique patterns byte make up 32,384 bytes, onto a single Xilinx Virtex 4LX-XC4VLX15 FPGA with a filtering rate of 2 Gbps.",
